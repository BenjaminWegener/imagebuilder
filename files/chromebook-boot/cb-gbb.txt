IMPORTANT: do all the below on your own risk, it might damage your chromebook - for me it worked perfectly fine the three times i did it

this will give you
- a niceer bootup screen (no longer the white chromeos one)
- a shorter delay until the boot starts (2sec and no more beep instead of 30sec and an annying beep)
- booting from usb will always be allowed (otherwise the chromebook might forget this when the batery gets empty)

- first remove the flash write protect screw (it is a sticker actually on the samsung snow chromebook inside of the notebook - see https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Samsung+Chromebook+Series+3+Teardown/12225)
- login into developer mode - see https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv7/samsung/samsung-chromebook
- on cmdline:
shell
sudo su
- go somewhere, where a "touch testfile" does not give an error, because the dir is read-only - the users homedir is an option
flashrom --wp-disable
flashrom --wp-status
- the meaning of the flags set below:
# GBB_FLAG_DEV_SCREEN_SHORT_DELAY     0x00000001
# GBB_FLAG_FORCE_DEV_SWITCH_ON        0x00000008
# GBB_FLAG_FORCE_DEV_BOOT_USB         0x00000010
/usr/share/vboot/bin/set_gbb_flags.sh 0x19
- read flash to file
flashrom -r bios.bin
- empty boot bitmap
touch nothing
- write boot bitmap to flash file
gbb_utility -s --bmpfv=nothing bios.bin
- write back flash
flashrom -w bios.bin
flashrom --wp-enable
- in case you get an error for that command speaking about --wp-range which seems to happen on newer chromeos versions
  then please do the following (see: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/write_protection.md#Enabling-write-protect)
fmap_decode bios.bin
- not down the range for WP_RO - usually it is 0x00000000 to 0x00200000 but better double check
- then rerun the failed command as (with the range noted down above)
flashrom --wp-enable --wp-range 0x00000000 0x00200000
- double check that the write protect is enabled again
flashrom --wp-status
- if everything is good you can shutdown your system now
- put the flash write protect screw/sticker back
